# 8086-assembly-programs
Sample programs in 8086 assembly language.

# a1p1
Write an Assembly Language Program to add two two-digit integers and store the result in DX register.

# a1p2
Write a program to compute the difference of two numbers and store the magnitude and sign in memory.

# a1p3
Write an ALP, which will prompt to enter your name as a string, and display the inputted string.

# a1p4
Write an ALP to check the length of a given string.

# a1p5
Write an ALP which will display a two-digit number that will be taken from keyboard.

# a2p1
Write an 8086 assembly language program to calculate the GCD of two unsigned 16 bit numbers.

# a2p2
Write an 8086 assembly language program to generate all prime numbers for a given range. For e.g. if anyone input the range 10 to 20, the program will return: 11, 13, 17, 19.

# a2p3
Write an 8086 alp to sort in ascending order using Insertion Sort algorithm, a given set of 16 bit unsigned numbers in memory.

# a2p4
Assume that two variables x and y are stored in unpacked BCD format. Write an 8086 alp to add x and y without using DAA and display the result in unpacked BCD format.

# a2p5
Write an 8086 alp to find out if a substring (which would be taken from keyboard) is present in a given string (which would be taken from keyboard) or not. If the substring is present it will return the location (or index) from where it matches otherwise print a negative massage.

# a2p6
Write a program to multiply two unsigned word integers and display the product. The integers are stored in two variables in the data segment, namely X and Y each of which is a “word” data. Store the product in a variable which is 4 bytes long. Handle overflow case.

# a2p7
Write an 8086 ALP to check for the password using DOS interrupt. If entry does not match with the password display "Wrong Password! Try Again" and remain in the loop, else display "You are authorized person" and come out. Set a counter so that maximum three try is possible, otherwise it will exit from the program.

# a2p8
Write an 8086 alp to read a string of 10 characters from keyboard and display the same at screen position (x1, y1) using BIOS interrupts. (x1, y1 can be stored value.)
